To be honest, I haven't really watched that many NBA games so far this season.
I've gotten swept up in the Bulls hype, so I've spent most of my time watching
the Carushow and the Warriors. But I have that nagging feeling that has only
been vindicated by the last couple weeks: the Bulls are PRETENDERS. Overreaction
alert, I know they're missing key guys like Zo and Zach, Caruso just came back 
on 1/19 for his first game since before Christmas, and they're still without
PWill who should provide some stopping power against these Nets and Warriors
teams.

But also, it just *feels* like the Bulls have barely been getting by in some of
their games. I think this story is partially told by looking at average point 
differential (as of 1/19):

| Team | Diff |
| - | - |
| GSW | +8.1 |
| PHX | +7.9 |
| UTA | +7.3 |
| CLE | +4.7 |
| MIA | +4.6 |
| MIL | +3.9 |
| MEM | +3.6 |
| DAL | +2.8 |
| CHI | +2.4 |
| BKN | +2.4 |

The Bulls and Nets aren't blowing teams out like the Suns and Warriors. Maybe
you could say that the Bulls have had a tougher schedule but a quick look at
[powerrankingsguru](http://powerrankingsguru.com/nba/strength-of-schedule.php)
has them as the 9th easiest schedule through 2022-01-18.

You could also look at this teams expected winning percentage based on points
scored and points allowed so far and see that they are outperforming this 
metric as well (details to come).
